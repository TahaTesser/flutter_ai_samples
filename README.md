A collection of Flutter samples that are automatically generated using AI (Anthropic Claude and OpenAI). The samples are refreshed daily to showcase different Flutter implementations and patterns.

## Features

- AI-generated Flutter code samples
- Daily updates with new samples
- Generated using multiple AI models:
  - Anthropic Claude
